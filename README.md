- 👋 Hi, I’m @KailynPaschall
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (that's why I am here) and a simple life that invovles gardening, roller skating and eating out at restaurants...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front End Development (Hope to have a fully functioning site coming asap!)...
- 💞️ Currently, I don't think I’m ready to collaborate but hopefully very soon...
- 📫 You can reach me at kailynpaschall@gmail.com
